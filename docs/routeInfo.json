This goal is one of my top priorities because success is a vector - it has a magnitude and a direction, and choosing the direction is the hard part. It&#39;s not enough to go somewhere. You have to go in the right direction otherwise you could end up like a soldier accidentally fighting for the wrong side - trying hard put not achieving your values. My goal is to find the most important values and plot my future course to achieve those values.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s not possible to ignore your future since you&#39;ll ultimately end up doing something. We&#39;re probably good at optimizing our lives in the short term but much less capable at long term planning, which makes sense given that the long term has been of little concern to people until now.</p>\n<p>This is where thought comes in. Careful thought can fill in the gap which intuition is not able to fill. The real value of deliberate thinking lies in optimizing our long term future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ideas\">Ideas</h2>\n<p>Below is a list of philosophical ideas I support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism\">Determinism:</a> the idea that all events are determined by past events. An important implication of determinism is that free will is not possible. Since our actions are determined by past experiences and genes, our decisions are bounded by the past making free will impossible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism\">Absurdism:</a> the scientific evidence we have accumulated so far suggests that the creation of our universe was a random improbable event and that there is no intrinsic meaning in the universe. One of the core ideas of absurdism is the human struggle to find meaning and purpose in an intrinsically meaningless universe.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism\">Fallibilism</a>: there are no facts which are one-hundred percent true. All knowledge is to some degree uncertain because imperfect perceptions are the source of all knowledge.</p>\n","folder":4},{"path":"home/resources","name":"Resources","parent":"home","contents":"<p>Money, time and energy are usually scarce and therefore are valuable.</p>\n","folder":3},{"path":"home/knowledge","name":"Knowledge","parent":"home","contents":"","folder":15},{"path":"home/plans","name":"Plans","parent":"home","contents":"<p>Some future plans I have and reviews on how well I am following them.</p>\n<p>A plan is a set of actions arranged across time.

Work takes up a large fraction of our lives so it&#39;s important that this time is meaningfully spent rather than just being used to finance other parts of our lives.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think the purpose of work is to either maintain or improve the state of the world. I don&#39;t think civilization has reached it&#39;s full potential so I&#39;d like to do whatever I can to preserve and improve our civilization. </p>\n<p>In my life, this might involve taking action to minimize existential risk and promoting the development of beneficial future technologies. Contributing to these areas could involve working directly in them or donating money to organizations that are already working in them.</p>\n","folder":3},{"path":"home/mind","name":"Mind","parent":"home","contents":"<p>Your mind affects every part of your life.
