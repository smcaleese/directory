<p>Our willpower is usually weaker than emotional resistance. The balance can be moved in favor of willpower by breaking large tasks into smaller subtasks. Subtasks require less willpower because they are shorter and easier and cause less emotional resistance because they are less daunting. Create subtasks to beat procrastination and fatigue.</p>
<h2 id="lower-the-activation-energy">Lower the Activation Energy</h2>
<p>It's possible to do ordinary work everyday and achieve extraordinary results in the long term because the work builds up over time. To achieve extraordinary results, consistency is important. Lowering the activation energy required to do work by making work easier to start fosters consistency. For example, you could leave your laptop open on your desk so that you can easily start working on it at any time.</p>
<h2 id="choose-what-you-want-to-work-on-carefully">Choose What You Want to Work on Carefully</h2>
<p>The direction you choose for you career matters more than how hard you work. You have to make choices and trade-offs because you don't have enough time to have many careers. The rational thing to do in response to this problem is to choose the best option based on whatever criteria you care about. Personally, I want to work on the areas that will most affect the future of civilization such as artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Small improvements in productivity per day can translate into huge differences in the long term. For example, saving ten minutes per day adds up to sixty hours of saved time per year.</p>

Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” - Will Durant</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Habits enable you to be more reliably productive because they make productivity automatic. To understand why consistency is important, consider the fact that you would be twice as productive if you did something everyday instead of every second day.</p>\n<p>You can acquire the consistency needed for high productivity if you create good habits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-create-habits\">How to Create Habits</h2>\n<p>James Clear outlines in his book &#39;Atomic Habits&#39; that to create a habit, the activity must be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Habits have a distinctive pattern involving three elements: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>a cue, a routine and a reward</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cue for a habit could be a certain time or place. At first, you have to consciously follow the cue with a routine and a reward. After many repetitions, the cue will create a craving for a reward which compels you to carry out the routine. The trick is to make sure the routine is something you want to be doing such as work as it&#39;s also possible to create bad habits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example\">Example</h2>\n<p>For example, if you want to get into the habit of reading before bed, the cue could be when you finish brushing your teeth, the routine is reading and the reward is the sense of accomplishment you have from executing the habit successfully.</p>\n<p>How to make it:</p>\n<p><strong>obvious:</strong> specify exactly what you want to do. In this case, you want to read.</p>\n<p><strong>attractive</strong>: read something you are interested in. If you have to read something, an external factor such as music can make the habit more attractive.</p>\n<p><strong>easy</strong>: make the habit short and easy to complete. Then you can increase the difficulty over time.</p>\n<p><strong>satisfying</strong>: have a reward at the end. Often, this can be a sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"habit-tracking\">Habit Tracking</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m using an app called Boosted to track how much time I spend on activities I want to be doing. The app allows you to start a timer for a certain activity. This acts as the cue. The routine is the work and the reward is the sense of accomplishment I feel when I see that I&#39;ve spent time on a productive activity.</p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/knowledge/work/productivityProjection","name":"Productivity Projection","parent":"home/knowledge/work","contents":"<h3 id=\"how-small-changes-now-become-big-changes-later\">How Small Changes Now Become Big Changes Later</h3>\n<p>Small changes in our daily routines may not seem significant, but these changes add up over time and have a  strong influence on which future we end up with.</p>\n<p>For example, saving one euro per day for a few years results in a sum of hundreds of Euro after a few years. The same principle applies to learning and productivity.</p>\n<p>Highly knowledgeable or accomplished people didn&#39;t instantly become that way. Instead, they learned or achieved a little bit more than everyone else per day resulting in them being far ahead after a long period of time.</p>\n<p>Our lives are like projections of our daily routines. Just as a fly landing on a projector lens could ruin a movie, small but wasteful activities per day can be very damaging over the long term. Wasting a few minutes here and there carelessly everyday really matters in the long term. The same applies for small positive activities - for example, consistent little jumps of progress everyday can become huge achievements in the long term. Laying a brick everyday results in a wall after enough time.</p>\n<p>To get the best possible future, it&#39;s important to see the significance of short but routine activities and not to fall into the trap of thinking that they&#39;re unimportant. We should be more afraid of small time-wasting activities and take small, positive habits more seriously.</p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/knowledge/work/zeroSumGames","name":"Zero Sum Games","parent":"home/knowledge/work","contents":"<p>Many situations are zero sum where the gain of one person is the loss of another.</p>\n<p>From a utilitarian perspective, the outcome of zero sum games does not matter. Imagine a God looking down at the flow of money. From its perspective, money just moves from place to place without changing the overall sum of money.</p>\n<p>However, the outcomes of zero sum games matter from an egoistic perspective. If two thieves wrestle over a gem, there is one gem to be had between two people so either outcome is neutral from a utilitarian perspective but not from an egoistic perspective. If thief A wins, he gets the gem. If he loses, thief B gets the gem and thief A doesn&#39;t.</p>\n<p>If you are thief A, assuming that you value yourself more than thief B, it makes sense to maximize the probability of winning the wrestle and getting the diamond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-win-zero-sum-games\">How to win Zero Sum Games</h2>\n<p>Expected value = size of reward x probability of getting the reward</p>\n<p>Assuming you have a goal in mind, increase the expected value by increasing the probability of success.</p>\n<h3 id=\"select-weaker-competitors\">Select Weaker Competitors</h3>\n<p>More generally, how do you win zero sum games. Zero sum games are fundamentally relative competitions.  To win them, you need to be better than your competitor(s). One way of improving your odds is to choose weak competitors. For instance, a football team with the choice between playing a weak and a strong team to get to the next round in a league should choose the weak team. Beating either team has the same reward - getting to the next round - but the team has a higher probability of beating the weak team so the expected value is higher.</p>\n<h3 id=\"increase-your-level-of-competence\">Increase Your Level of Competence</h3>\n<p>Increasing your competence increases your chance of winning in a competition. If you lie right in the middle of the bell curve, then your chance of winning against a random competitor is 50%. If your level of competence is at the 90th percentile, you have a 90% percent chance of beating a random competitor since most of your competitors will be average which is worse than you. Therefore, become as effective as possible to maximize your chance of winning competitions.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://directory.stephenmcaleese.net/home/mind/improvement\">this</a> article I explain how to improve.</p>\n","folder":0}]},"siteData":{"title":"React Static"}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/bootstrap.bd1d042d.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/src/containers/Note.4d41f4ed.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.7578e5b0.js"></script></body></html>
