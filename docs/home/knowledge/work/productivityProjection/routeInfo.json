The same principle applies to learning and productivity.</p>\n<p>Highly knowledgeable or accomplished people didn&#39;t instantly become that way. Instead, they learned or achieved a little bit more than everyone else per day resulting in them being far ahead after a long period of time.</p>\n<p>Our lives are like projections of our daily routines. Just as a fly landing on a projector lens could ruin a movie, small but wasteful activities per day can be very damaging over the long term. Wasting a few minutes here and there carelessly everyday really matters in the long term. The same applies for small positive activities - for example, consistent little jumps of progress everyday can become huge achievements in the long term. Laying a brick everyday results in a wall after enough time.</p>\n<p>To get the best possible future, it&#39;s important to see the significance of short but routine activities and not to fall into the trap of thinking that they&#39;re unimportant. We should be more afraid of small time-wasting activities and take small, positive habits more seriously.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
