<p>Habits enable you to be more reliably productive because they make productivity automatic. To understand why consistency is important, consider the fact that you would be twice as productive if you did something everyday instead of every second day.</p>
<p>You can acquire the consistency needed for high productivity if you create good habits.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-habits">How to Create Habits</h2>
<p>James Clear outlines in his book 'Atomic Habits' that to create a habit, the activity must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying</li>
</ul>
<p>Habits have a distinctive pattern involving three elements: </p>
<ul>
<li>a cue, a routine and a reward</li>
</ul>
<p>The cue for a habit could be a certain time or place. At first, you have to consciously follow the cue with a routine and a reward. After many repetitions, the cue will create a craving for a reward which compels you to carry out the routine. The trick is to make sure the routine is something you want to be doing such as work as it's also possible to create bad habits.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For example, if you want to get into the habit of reading before bed, the cue could be when you finish brushing your teeth, the routine is reading and the reward is the sense of accomplishment you have from executing the habit successfully.</p>
<p>How to make it:</p>
<p><strong>obvious:</strong> specify exactly what you want to do. In this case, you want to read.</p>
<p><strong>attractive</strong>: read something you are interested in. If you have to read something, an external factor such as music can make the habit more attractive.</p>
<p><strong>easy</strong>: make the habit short and easy to complete. Then you can increase the difficulty over time.</p>
<p><strong>satisfying</strong>: have a reward at the end. Often, this can be a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<h2 id="habit-tracking">Habit Tracking</h2>
<p>I'm using an app called Boosted to track how much time I spend on activities I want to be doing. The app allows you to start a timer for a certain activity. This acts as the cue. The routine is the work and the reward is the sense of accomplishment I feel when I see that I've spent time on a productive activity.</p>
