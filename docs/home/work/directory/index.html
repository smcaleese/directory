<p>Directory is a collection of my thoughts, ideas, plans and knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>Directory acts as a guide for my actions. My memory is too small for everything I need to know so I'm using Directory to store my most useful ideas, knowledge and values which I can use to make better decisions.</p>
<p>Thinking about your life consciously is difficult but any effort in this direction is better than none.</p>
<p>I've open-sourced Directory because I believe that knowledge is usually most valuable when shared among as many individuals as possible - sharing knowledge has almost no cost and can be highly beneficial.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>Directory runs on React, but compiles down to Javascript and is served as static files on Github.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>Directory was created in February 2019</p>
<p>Directory is inspired by <a href="https://directory.gytis.co">Gytis Daujotas's Directory</a></p>
