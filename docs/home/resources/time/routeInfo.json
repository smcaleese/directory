Live as if there will be no tomorrow. Don&#39;t procrastinate. Cut out things in your life which don&#39;t provide much value. For me, I&#39;ve found texting to sometimes be a waste of time. Set clear goals and go after them.</p>\n<p>As humans, we tend to be reactive. We lose something and then resolve to fix the problem. With time, this is not an option. Time wasted can never be renewed. Therefore there is a cost to being reactive. A better approach is to take a proactive approach - spend time carefully regardless of your past experience.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
