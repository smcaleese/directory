The problem is how to decide how to spend your time.</p>\n<p>A 40 year career is less than 15,000 days which isn&#39;t that many days. Think about how short a day is. When you multiply something relatively small by something small, you get something small. Therefore, life is short.</p>\n<p>We live as if we will live forever but our time is probably limited. We live as if each day as if tomorrow is a renewal of today. The reality is that yesterday is not an old version of today. Yesterday is gone and every day spent is gone forever.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-do\">What To Do</h2>\n<p>Since time is more valuable than we think, we should have a greater sense of urgency. Live as if there will be no tomorrow. Don&#39;t procrastinate. Cut out things in your life which don&#39;t provide much value. For me, I&#39;ve found texting to sometimes be a waste of time. Set clear goals and go after them.</p>\n<p>As humans, we tend to be reactive. We lose something and then resolve to fix the problem. With time, this is not an option. Time wasted can never be renewed. Therefore there is a cost to being reactive. A better approach is to take a proactive approach - spend time carefully regardless of your past experience.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
