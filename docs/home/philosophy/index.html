<h2 id="the-purpose-of-philosophy-for-me">The Purpose of Philosophy For Me</h2>
<p>I want to think carefully about what I value so that achieving my goals has the greatest positive effect. This goal is one of my top priorities because success is a vector - it has a magnitude and a direction, and choosing the direction is the hard part. It's not enough to go somewhere. You have to go in the right direction otherwise you could end up like a soldier accidentally fighting for the wrong side - trying hard put not achieving your values. My goal is to find the most important values and plot my future course to achieve those values.</p>
<p>It's not possible to ignore your future since you'll ultimately end up doing something. We're probably good at optimizing our lives in the short term but much less capable at long term planning, which makes sense given that the long term has been of little concern to people until now.</p>
<p>This is where thought comes in. Careful thought can fill in the gap which intuition is not able to fill. The real value of deliberate thinking lies in optimizing our long term future.</p>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<p>Below is a list of philosophical ideas I support.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism">Determinism:</a> the idea that all events are determined by past events. An important implication of determinism is that free will is not possible. Since our actions are determined by past experiences and genes, our decisions are bounded by the past making free will impossible.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">Absurdism:</a> the scientific evidence we have accumulated so far suggests that the creation of our universe was a random improbable event and that there is no intrinsic meaning in the universe. One of the core ideas of absurdism is the human struggle to find meaning and purpose in an intrinsically meaningless universe.</p>

Put effort into things you can control and accept what you cannot control. Another main idea is to focus on controlling your mind. Since you have more control over your mind than most other factors, it makes sense to make the most of our ability to control our minds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"be-independent-of-your-environment\">Be Independent of Your Environment</h2>\n<p>Stoics strive to maintain a calm and stable mental state regardless of the environment. Thus their happiness is independent of what is happening externally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.&quot; - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"have-a-sense-of-urgency\">Have a Sense of Urgency</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life.
