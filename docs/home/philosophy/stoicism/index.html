<p>Stoicism teaches that most events are beyond your control so trying to control them only leads to frustration. Put effort into things you can control and accept what you cannot control. Another main idea is to focus on controlling your mind. Since you have more control over your mind than most other factors, it makes sense to make the most of our ability to control our minds.</p>
<h2 id="be-independent-of-your-environment">Be Independent of Your Environment</h2>
<p>Stoics strive to maintain a calm and stable mental state regardless of the environment. Thus their happiness is independent of what is happening externally.</p>

<p><em>"You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</em></p>

<p><em>"Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day. … The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time."</em> - Seneca</p>

<h2 id="negative-visualization">Negative Visualization</h2>
<p>Imagine something being taken away from you. This exercise will help you to appreciate what you already have.</p>
<h2 id="see-the-silver-lining">See the Silver Lining</h2>
<p>An interesting idea of Stoicism is reinterpreting negative events as positive. For example, see tasks you have to do as opportunities to improve or try your best, see problems as opportunities and failures as learning opportunities.</p>
