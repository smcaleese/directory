<h2 id="altruism">Altruism</h2>
<p>I'll define altruism as prioritizing the needs of others over your own needs. A case can be made for altruism - other people are very similar to us (taking a wide view) so it could be argued that each person in the world is roughly equally valuable. If this is true, then the most important factor determining what decisions we make should be how our decisions affect other people. If you make a decision that affects you and thousands of other people and you value other people as much as you value yourself, then you would classify the impact of your decision on other people as far more important than the impact of the decision on you. A person with this mindset would live for others and prioritize the needs of others over their own. If one also considers the impact of their actions on future people, then the ratio of the importance of others to that person would grow even larger. It would be rational for a person with such a view to be extremely altruistic where the decisions they make are almost entirely determined by their impact on the vast number of present and potential future people.</p>
<h2 id="selfishness">Selfishness</h2>
<p>Selfishness is defined - in this context - as the tendency to prioritize your own needs over others' needs. There are some arguments in favor of selfishness. For example, maybe people are better at managing their own needs without interference from others. This point is supported by research that shows that gift-giving is not the optimal way of using resources. However, since some people are not able to provide for themselves, a complete lack of altruism would lead to extra inequality and preventable suffering. Also we intuitively discount the value of other people, especially people who are not related to us or who we don't know. Would you sacrifice your life to save a stranger? A person with an impersonal perspective who values themselves and the stranger equally would have no preference - not saving the stranger results in the same loss as saving the stranger and dying. In a society of completely impersonal people, half of the population would choose to save the stranger and the other half would save themselves.</p>
<p>I imagine that, in the real world, most people would choose to save themselves then a random stranger. If this is true, then in the example above, the number of people who would decide to save themselves would be greater. This intuitively makes sense but evolution also predicts this behavioral pattern. In his book "The Selfish Gene", Richard Dawkins explains how we are designed to promote the survival of our genes and why we value ourselves most, then our families and then strangers. We share 100% of my genes with ourselves, 50% with our siblings and parents and much less with strangers. It is no coincidence that altruism is related to the how close we are genetically to others. We also show a limited form of altruism to friends but this form of altruism tends to be reciprocal where each party benefits. True altruism where one person loses something so that someone else can gain something is more common in blood relatives. The most familiar example of this kind of altruism is when a mother makes sacrifices for her children.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-and-ethics">Evolution and Ethics</h2>
<p>We may have built-in goals to increase the frequency of our genes in the gene pool but is this right? I don't think increasing the frequency of your genes in the gene pool is morally good. Instead, our moral systems are built on evolutionary rules of thumb designed promote the survival of our genes which we call feelings. For example, a world with less hunger and pain would be a better world. We value the quality of our conscious experience not the goals built into us by evolution even though our experience is heavily influenced by evolution. Therefore, achieving our evolutionary goals would increase the quality of our conscious experience. For example, eating satisfies the our built-in desire to survive and results in a better quality of life.</p>
<h2 id="maximize-well-being-not-evolutionary-goals">Maximize Well-Being Not Evolutionary Goals</h2>
<p>Although our personal goal of maximizing our quality of life is closely tied to how well we are achieving our evolutionary goals, these goals are not equal to each other. The fact that we have negative emotions is evidence that there is conflict between our personal goals and the goals of our genes. We have negative emotions not because they improve our quality of life but because they improve our chance of survival. Satisfying our evolutionary goals happens to improve our quality of life but evolution's goal is not to maximize our quality of life. Another problem with evolution is that it has created zero-sum games to increase our reproductive success but which limit the total happiness of a group of people. For example, only ten people in each country can enjoy being on the list of the richest ten people in that country. If everyone were to become wealthier, there would still be ten people on that list and so the total happiness in a population resulting from high social status cannot increase beyond a certain point.</p>
<p>Since survival today is much less difficult than it was in the past, we could implement new cultural norms that prioritize happiness and bias our natural desires towards achieving happiness. Further into the future, we could change re-engineer ourselves to have the built-in goal of maximize well-being as opposed to our current built-in goal of maximizing reproductive success.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Outright altruism or selfishness are controversial so maybe the best way of doing things is to take actions that maximize the the wellbeing of yourself and the wellbeing of others. For example, one way of doing this is to do work that you are passionate about that also benefits other people as much as possible.</p>
<p>Since evolution is amoral, it may be morally right for us to fundamentally change our bodies and brains to attain more happiness and well-being.</p>
