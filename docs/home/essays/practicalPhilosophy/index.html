<p>Questioning the reasoning behind our actions eventually leads to questions that are difficult to answer. But yet, we still go about our daily business without decision paralysis. If these questions are murky and hard to define, let alone answer, how can this be?</p>
<p>While we have conscious confusion around our motivations, we still know what to do because of powerful and flexible unconscious intuitions. In some ways, these intuitions are vastly superior to conscious thought - they can be changed quickly moment by moment and they allow us to create complex conclusions with little effort.</p>
<p>These intuitions serve as a pretty good guide for what we should do in our lives. When you are unhappy, it is often quite obvious what is missing in your life after a little reflection. I believe that much of humanities impressive progress has been driven by these intuitions. People in the past simply wanted more comfort and less work so they invented technology. Our intuition often has a clear picture of what we want. This phenomenon is well described by this quote from Steve Jobs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even though our intuition is impressive, it is not without its own flaws. Intuition is opaque and unexplainable which makes it difficult to debug. Also, our intuition is colored by our evolutionary origins some of which are irrelevant in the modern world. And since our intuition is fairly opaque to observation, we cannot easily spot when we are under the influence of an irrational emotion or cognitive bias. You may know what you want intuitively but if you were to consciously examine your motivations carefully then what would you find? Maybe the motivations that once drove you would seem ridiculous and petty once you uncovered their origin.</p>
<p>This is where conscious thought steps in. Conscious thought is highly visible to observation (since it is conscious), which allows each logical step to be tested and refined continually. Conscious thought and intuition are analogous to custom made suits and standard-sized clothes, respectively. Conscious thought often to lead to conclusions that are more robust and true but at the cost of slowness and effort. Meanwhile, intuition can be used to get a rough and ready overview.</p>
<p>Big decisions that don't need to be made many times and demand a high level of accuracy are better made using conscious thought where possible though intuition should still play a role. On the other hand, intuition is much better for making small decisions or making sure that your logical conclusions do not defy common sense. Intuition is also useful for generating creative leaps when you are stuck in the same pattern of thought.</p>
<p>Overall combining intuition and conscious thought is almost certainly the best way to think. Though these mental tools are only useful when used in the right setting. Just like a builder, if you want to build a house then you need to use multiple tools.</p>
