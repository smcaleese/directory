The book is called 'Civilization: The West and the Rest'.</p>
<p>Below, my goal is to explain how western Europe advanced so quickly and dominated the rest of the world. I then explain how the insights learned from history can be applied to your life to make you more effective.</p>
<h1 id="change">Change</h1>
<p>Europe was made up of dozens of small, autonomous states which competed with each other for economic and political power. Meanwhile, China in the east was a large monolithic empire. Chinese values around the 1400s promoted harmony and stability. While European states were developing new innovations to out-compete their rivals, China was focused on maintaining equilibrium. Since there cannot be improvement without change, China stagnated while Europe continued to improve.</p>
<p>Over a short period of time, the difference in progress would not have been noticeable. But over time, incremental innovations added up to give Europe huge military and and economic advantages.</p>
<h3 id="science-vs-religion">Science vs Religion</h3>
<p>Science and religion have two different approaches to truth. Science takes ignorance as an initially condition. The goal from that initial condition is to change and learn constantly. Because ignorance is the starting point of science, science encourages a disdain of the past and hope for a more enlightened future.</p>
<p>Religion teaches quite the opposite. In many religions, the full truth was discovered in the past and the goal of the present and future is to preserve that knowledge. The problem is that many religions teachings are vague and unfalsifiable. When a theory cannot be falsified, we cannot discard it, move on and make progress. Since religion often teaches that the truth is in the past, there is an incentive to not make any changes to your beliefs - any change would be viewed as moving away from the truth.</p>
<p>This view would make sense if your religious beliefs were right. But since many religions beliefs - such as the belief that the earth is the center of the universe as Christians believed in the middle ages - are wrong, Religion tends to stop progress by stopping changes in belief.</p>
<h1 id="spreading-of-ideas">Spreading of Ideas</h1>
<p>In Europe, people shared and copied ideas. For example, Benjamin Robbins, an Englishman, wrote 'New Principles of Gunnery' which greatly improved the accuracy of artillery. Prussia later used the ideas described to improve the accuracy of their artillery. Leonard Euler, the famous mathematician, improved the book. Isaac Newton built on top of the work of George Hook when working on gravity.</p>
<p>These examples shows how ideas were constantly being shared and copied in Europe. Someone would come up with a new useful idea. Then everyone else would copy it making the idea a new standard. In the process of copying, someone else might improve the idea. This process of sharing, copying and changing lead to rapid progress. The copying part is significant because other people would not have been able to improve ideas if they did not have access to them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the Ottoman Empire, printing and the astronomical predictions were banned because they were deemed blasphemous. The Ottomans couldn't access the latest scientific work from Europe and fell behind. </p>
<h1 id="reason-vs-tradition">Reason vs Tradition</h1>
<p>The system of law implemented in the Ottoman Empire was based on religious principles. Since religion does not change and is rarely questioned, Sharia Law, like most things associated with religion, was rarely questioned and thus didn't change or improve.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Europe, the Church and state were separated. This meant that law could freely change and be questioned. Over time, laws could be changed, debated and improved. Consequently, European countries ended up with much more effective systems of government than the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>The freedom of expression that is possible in the absence of religious oppression is also matters in the context of improvement. The ability to express your ideas and arguments openly as writing or speech moves ideas from the subconscious to the conscious mind.</p>
<p>These ideas can then be consciously critiqued. We have two systems of thought in our minds - system one and system two. System one is fast and intuitive but error prone. The more conscious and thoughtful system two is much better suited to the analysis of ideas.</p>
<p>Freedom of writing and speech promoted system two thinking. System two is better at picking up errors than system one. As a result, Europeans were more likely to pick up faulty laws. The problem is not making mistakes - it's making mistakes and not fixing them because either you are not aware them or unwilling to fix them because of some kind of dogma. Europeans would have been better at picking up on mistakes and when you are aware of mistakes, you are more likely to fix them.</p>
<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
<p>Surprisingly, China was ahead of Europe in seafaring. Admiral Zhong He, a famous Chinese explorer, had already reached east Africa by 1420, decades before Columbus visited the Caribbean. So why did Europe create global Empires and not China?</p>
<p>One reason is that ocean going vessels were banned not long after Zhong He's voyages. This made further exploration almost impossible. Meanwhile in Europe, many of the Kings and Queens in Europe promoted exploration. The takeaway is that incentives and punishment have a significant influence on behavior.</p>
<p>But even if China continued to explore, Europe may still have prevailed. Another key difference between European and Chinese sailors is how their motives differed. Chinese sailors went abroad to show off their might and acquire gifts to bring back to China.</p>
<p>European sailors, on the other hand, had much more practical motives. Portuguese sailors went to Asia by sailing eastwards not to show off but to find another way to get spices. Other European explorers had similarly practical motives. Over time Europe set up forts, trading posts and colonies in Asia and profited from them. European explorers were more interested in exploring for their own long term economic and strategic benefit than the Chinese. </p>
<p>The European explorers also pursued their goals with more fervor. For example, Vasco de Gama forced the port of Calcutta to open for trade by bombarding it. For the Europeans, exploration was much more than just an exercise in showing off - it was a way to outdo their nearby competitors on the European mainland. The competitiveness, focus and urgency of the European explorers was another significant advantage they had over the Chinese.</p>
<p>What can we learn from the contrast between the Chinese and European explorers?  Certainly, the goals you choose are important in determining long term outcomes. Also, incentives and punishments are powerful ways of changing behavior and competition can help you achieve your goals more quickly and thoroughly.</p>
<h1 id="applying-the-lessons-learned-above-to-your-personal-life">Applying the Lessons Learned Above to your Personal Life</h1>
<p>Learning about history is interesting, but what we learn from history can also be useful in our own personal lives. So how can we personally make use of the advantages the West had over other parts of the world?</p>
<h2 id="change">Change</h2>
<p>Unlike most of the world, Europe was constantly changing and innovating. To improve, we can try new things, experiment and change our current methods of doing things. Often, change results in negative progress but occasionally a change results in improvement. Change can be done with foresight - you can imagine how you could be better, but sometimes blind or random change can also lead to improvement. This is especially relevant to evolution which has produced all its improvements through blind, unplanned change.</p>
<h2 id="science-vs-religion">Science vs Religion</h2>
<p>Although, religion has much less of an influence on people's mind than it has in the past - from my own experience - religious thinking is still surprising common. 'Religious' thinkers tend to have black and white beliefs, aren't open to new ideas, resist changes to their own beliefs, don't question their own beliefs. Religious thinkers also tend to be arrogant - they assume that their view of the world is right rather than acknowledging that there is always some uncertainty about whether a fact is true or not and sometimes we are just plain wrong about things.</p>
<p>The opposite of a 'religious' or irrational thinker is a rational thinker. Why would you want to be a rational thinker? A rational thinker is more equipped to create an accurate model of reality. This model can then be used to achieve goals.</p>
<p>Rational thinkers acknowledge that their beliefs may be wrong and are willing to change their beliefs in the future as a result. They are also open to new ideas and acknowledge that it is a lot easier to be wrong than to be right.</p>
<h2 id="spreading-of-ideas">Spreading of Ideas</h2>
<p>Learn from other people. Sharing your ideas and getting other perspectives on your ideas can reveal oversights or mistakes you missed. Also, ideas you share could be improved in unexpected ways by other people.</p>
<h2 id="reason-vs-tradition">Reason vs Tradition</h2>
<p>Make important decisions consciously because this process allows you to carefully analyze each step of your decision making. Realize that the traditional way of doing things is not necessarily the best way. New ideas that make sense may be superior.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Choose your goals carefully and consider the long term consequences. Competition can increase your motivation to achieve your goals. </p>
