But yet, we still go about our daily business without decision paralysis. If these questions are murky and hard to define, let alone answer, how can this be?</p>\n<p>While we have conscious confusion around our motivations, we still know what to do because of powerful and flexible unconscious intuitions. In some ways, these intuitions are vastly superior to conscious thought - they can be changed quickly moment by moment and they allow us to create complex conclusions with little effort.</p>\n<p>These intuitions serve as a pretty good guide for what we should do in our lives. When you are unhappy, it is often quite obvious what is missing in your life after a little reflection. I believe that much of humanities impressive progress has been driven by these intuitions. People in the past simply wanted more comfort and less work so they invented technology. Our intuition often has a clear picture of what we want. This phenomenon is well described by this quote from Steve Jobs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, even though our intuition is impressive, it is not without its own flaws. Intuition is opaque and unexplainable which makes it difficult to debug. Also, our intuition is colored by our evolutionary origins some of which are irrelevant in the modern world. And since our intuition is fairly opaque to observation, we cannot easily spot when we are under the influence of an irrational emotion or cognitive bias. You may know what you want intuitively but if you were to consciously examine your motivations carefully then what would you find? Maybe the motivations that once drove you would seem ridiculous and petty once you uncovered their origin.</p>\n<p>This is where conscious thought steps in. Conscious thought is highly visible to observation (since it is conscious), which allows each logical step to be tested and refined continually. Conscious thought and intuition are analogous to custom made suits and standard-sized clothes, respectively. Conscious thought often to lead to conclusions that are more robust and true but at the cost of slowness and effort. Meanwhile, intuition can be used to get a rough and ready overview.</p>\n<p>Big decisions that don&#39;t need to be made many times and demand a high level of accuracy are better made using conscious thought where possible though intuition should still play a role. On the other hand, intuition is much better for making small decisions or making sure that your logical conclusions do not defy common sense. Intuition is also useful for generating creative leaps when you are stuck in the same pattern of thought.</p>\n<p>Overall combining intuition and conscious thought is almost certainly the best way to think. Though these mental tools are only useful when used in the right setting. Just like a builder, if you want to build a house then you need to use multiple tools.</p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/essays/acceleratingAndDiminishingReturns","name":"Accelerating And Diminishing Returns","parent":"home/essays","contents":"<h2 id=\"diminishing-returns\">Diminishing returns</h2>\n<p>It makes sense to apply effort to activities with diminishing returns but only up to a point. At first, one unit of effort might yield two units so -1 effort + 2 gain = 1 net. Therefore the activity is worthwhile initially. After a while the same increase in effort will yield less and less results as the graph below shows. Eventually, as you apply more effort each unit of effort will yield almost no return so you will only experience net losses. At this point, it makes sense to stop investing effort. Brushing your teeth is an activity which experiences diminishing returns - after one minute, your teeth will be, say, 90% clean, 95% clean after the second minute and 98% clean after the third minute. It doesn&#39;t make sense to brush your teeth for ten minutes because the time wasted is greater than the cleanliness. Diminishing returns also applies to goods you buy in the shop. Five boxes of cereal is not five times more valuable than one box and if you were to buy a thousand boxes, the curve would actually move downward due to the inconvenience of storing them. The law of diminishing returns explains why people generally don&#39;t brush their teeth for an hour a day or buy hundreds of boxes of cereal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/utlity-function-risk-aversion.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"accelerating-returns\">Accelerating Returns</h2>\n<p>Accelerating returns is the opposite of diminishing returns - each additional unit of effort yields a greater return up to a point and it is rational to apply more effort over time instead of less with time. Accelerating relationships between effort and returns is probably less common than diminishing returns but has a larger impact. </p>\n<p>Initially, one unit of effort may yield one unit of output. The second unit of effort yields two units, then three or four and so on. As each extra unit of effort has a greater reward than the last, it makes sense to continue to apply effort until the curve plateaus or until you are too tired. The law of accelerating returns applies in areas such as business, fame and sport. The &#39;winner-takes-all&#39; scenario is a more extreme version of the law of accelerating returns. In this scenario, the beginning of the curve is almost completely flat and then suddenly spikes up when a large amount of effort is applied.</p>\n<p>In winner-takes-all scenarios, there are two rational ways of acting - you should either apply no effort to minimize costs or you should apply maximum effort so that you get to the right side of the graph and pay off the effort-debt you have accumulated. Those who are in the middle of the graph are in the worst position - they have invested quite a lot of effort and received nothing in return.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dlF3b.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I haven&#39;t described linear relationships because, in the real world, I don&#39;t think true linear relationships are that common. Relationships that appear linear might actually be slightly diminishing or accelerating. For example, a wage job seems linear at first, but actually the money earned has diminishing value - being twice as wealth probably won&#39;t double your standard of living.</p>\n<h2 id=\"applying-accelerating-and-diminishing-returns-to-your-life\">Applying Accelerating and Diminishing Returns to Your Life</h2>\n<p>The majority of situations your will encounter in your life probably involve only diminishing returns. Therefore for many of your decisions, you should take a balanced approach where you apply a small amount of effort and get a reasonable return. Fortunately this pattern of behavior is already fairly common - people buy a wide variety of groceries, stay fairly fit, acquire enough money for comfort and generally have a balanced approach to life.</p>\n<p>However, this approach does not work when you are dealing with accelerating returns. The actor, athlete or entrepreneur who invests a moderate amount of effort will probably fail so they need to work hard. This is counter intuitive because most scenarios involve diminishing returns where hard work does not pay off - investing hours into brushing your teeth is wasteful. But that is not the case with sport, fame or music.</p>\n<p>Mozart and Tiger Woods are examples of prodigies who have put in an extreme amount of effort which yielded an extremely high return. Tiger Woods was the first sports billionaire and Mozart is still famous 227 years later (as of 2019) - I recently heard one of his songs in a Burger King ad. However, although extreme effort can yield extraordinary results, it is also risky as there are many failures for every great success in winner-takes-all fields such as sport. If you want to succeed in these fields, you have to compete as hard as you can for the small chance of glory or not participate at all to cut your losses.</p>\n<p>This same rule applies to startups. Most startups fail and some achieve spectacular success. Although luck is often involved, the founders that are most involved in what they are doing are the most likely to succeed. Taking luck into account, if luck is on your side, go for it but if your luck is against you, maybe you should avoid competing to avoid potential losses.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, in most areas of life the best strategy is to apply moderate effort (eg. brushing your teeth). Though in some fields - such as entrepreneurship or sport - a small number of extremely dedicated people can enjoy a much greater return on their effort even taking into account the extra effort applied - Tiger Woods may have worked twice as hard as the average golfer, but he netted ten or twenty times more money and fame. Elon Musk also falls in this category - he worked incredibly hard to create Tesla which netted which ultimately resulted in very high financial gains. But if he had put been less committed, Tesla probably would have failed and he would have gained nothing. Although these kinds of fields seem attractive because of the high rewards associated with them, there is also a high risk of failure which needs to be taken into account.</p>\n<p>To summarize, find out where accelerating and diminishing returns apply to your life. If there are diminishing returns then invest some effort but not too much. If you are doing something that involves accelerating returns such as getting out of poverty (wealth begets wealth), then invest a lot of effort. If you are in a winner-takes-all field involving strongly accelerating returns, then you should either invest an extremely large amount of effort, go all in and get to the top or cut your losses.</p>\n<p>There are two rational ways to be - if there are diminishing returns such as when cleaning your house, you should apply some effort but not too much. If there are accelerating returns, then you should try much harder but only do so if you have a reasonable chance of success. This route has a higher potential reward but is also more risky.</p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/essays/theChallengeOfThe21stCentury","name":"The Challenge Of The21st Century","parent":"home/essays","contents":"<p>The 21st century could be the most important century in in all of the history of civilization.</p>\n<p>Civilization as a whole was not in serious danger throughout history until the 20th century because of the advent of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. Global warming also threatens civilization but we have time to adapt to it since it occurs over a relatively long time period. Only after the invention of nukes did human extinction become a real possibility. Natural disasters such as asteroid strikes are equally dangerous but they do not occur often. Therefore dangerous technologies are the primary threat to the existence of civilization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peak-extinction-risk-in-the-21st-century\">Peak Extinction Risk in the 21st Century</h3>\n<p>Only one dangerous technology - nuclear weapons - was introduced in the 20th century. But we could see the invention of several technologies rivaling or exceeding the riskiness of nuclear weapons in the 21st century such as genetic engineering, molecular manufacturing and ASI (artificial super intelligence). Thus humanity&#39;s risk of extinction could be much higher in the 21st century than the 20th century. But what about the 22nd century? I think that the extinction risk posed by advanced technologies will decrease after the 21st century because we will probably develop a more mature understanding of how to use these technologies responsibly. For example, an increased understanding of the consequences of nuclear war has led to nuclear disarmament. The severity of a nuclear war would be lower now than it would have been in the 1980&#39;s when the size of the global nuclear stockpile was at its largest. Likewise, a technology such as ASI may initially be very dangerous due to ignorance around how to use it safely but then increased wisdom may eventually increase its safety. A similar pattern could be seen with nuclear power. The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was the most severe nuclear incident to ever occur. After that, improved safety methods around nuclear power have prevented such a severe event from recurring or at least reduce the probability of such an event recurring.</p>\n<p>This pattern of technological development and then subsequent improvements in safety has occurred in the past for dangerous technologies but a different pattern may emerge for really dangerous technologies such as ASI. We may not have the opportunity to have an Chernobyl for AI which we can learn from. Instead the outcome could be much more polarized - either we build the technology safely from the outset or extinction occurs. This pattern would also explain why the extinction risk facing humanity would be lower in the 22nd century - either the technology is created safely resulting in low further risk or extinction occurs. If we face these two possibilities in the future then there could be a high risk time period to get through followed by a very long and safe future.</p>\n<p>The 20th and 21st centuries could be analogous to the birth of a baby – the baby is safe while in the womb and as a child but the process of birth is difficult to survive. If this analogy is true, then humanity could be passing through it’s difficult birth phase.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vBoXdWle608/ScudEn8PETI/AAAAAAAAADQ/bawM5Yl5zlI/s1600/Existential+Risk,+Probability+2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Notes on graph:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this graph assumes that Superintelligent AI, molecular manufacturing, genetic engineering and other dangerous technologies will be created some time in the 21st century.</li>\n<li>even if these dates are incorrect, then the scales of the graph would merely need to be rescaled.</li>\n<li>In the far future, the level of existential risk would fall because we would either develop the ability to use advanced technologies safely or go extinct.</li>\n<li>the percentage extinction risk per year which the peaks represent does not really matter – any reduction in extinction risk would be incredibly beneficial.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"why-does-this-matter-\">Why does this matter?</h3>\n<p>If the extinction of humanity occurs sometime in the 21st century or later, then an enormous number of future potential people or other sentient minds would not come into existence. From an impersonal (non egoistic) perspective, an extinction event would result in the loss of humanity’s entire future which would be an enormous loss given that civilization could be around for trillions of years or longer. Even those that have a purely egoistic (selfish) perspective could benefit from the avoidance of an extinction event since they would live longer as a result.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Reducing extinction risk could be one of the highest priorities for humanity in the 21st century.

An existential risk is an event which could cause an existential catastrophe.</p>\n<p>I think the question of whether existential risk matters is really important because an existential catastrophe would be such an impactful event. Therefore any effort put into understanding or reducing existential risk could have a very large positive impact.</p>\n<p>For instance, an informal poll in 2008 at a conference on catastrophic risks found they believe it’s pretty likely we’ll face a catastrophe that kills over a billion people, and estimate a 19% chance of extinction before 2100.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-could-existential-risk-be-important-\">Why Could Existential Risk be Important?</h3>\n<p>If an existential catastrophe occurred, everyone who would have come into existence in the future had the event not occurred would not come into existence. If we value each other those future individuals as much as we value the lives of people today, then humanity would lose almost all of its future potential - a tremendously large loss. Earth originating intelligent life has the potential to survive for trillions of years. Therefore the total number of people or other types of minds that could exist in that time period would be extremely large and the ratio of the number of future people to people currently alive would be very high. If we value each of these potential lives as much as we value people currently alive, then our actions should overwhelmingly be determined by their effect on our descendants.</p>\n<h3 id=\"should-we-discount-the-value-of-future-people-\">Should We Discount the Value of Future People?</h3>\n<p>But the position I explained above assumes that each future descendant is as valuable as people currently alive today. Does that make sense? Personally, I&#39;m not sure whether we should value each of our descendants live&#39;s as much as we value our own or whether we should discount the value of their lives. In the book &quot;Superintelligence&quot;, Nick Bostrom estimates that our universe could support at least 10 ^ 58 lives in its entire future (including computer-emulated minds). Even if we decided to discount the value of future lives relative to the value of people currently alive by a factor of one thousand (where the value of 1 person currently alive = the value of 1000 future people), the total value of our future descendants would still outweigh the value of all people currently alive by a factor of 10 ^ 45 (1).</p>\n<p>Decision theory says that we should make a list of all possible outcomes, determine the positive or negative value for each outcome and multiply the probability of each outcome by each value to calculate the expected value (2). For example, dropping and breaking your phone is a possible outcome which could have a negative expected value of -5 (depends on the person). If the probability of this outcome occurring is 0.5, then the expected value is -5 x 0.5 = -2.5.</p>\n<p>Above I explained how the the total value of all our future descendants could be worth 10 ^ 45 times more than the total value of all people alive today. However, I made this decision under uncertainty because I am not sure if my assumptions are true. Applying decision theory to the problem helps to deal with this uncertainty. Even if we decide that the above conclusion has only a 1% chance of being true, then the expected value is (10 ^ 45) x 0.01 = 10 ^ 43. This means that even when the uncertainty of the conclusion above is taken into account the value of our descendants is still 10 ^ 43 times greater than the value of all people alive today.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-this-inform-our-actions-as-a-society-\">How Does This Inform Our Actions as a Society?</h3>\n<p>It may be true that how our actions affect our descendants matters much more than how they affect us as calculated above. However, this conclusion is blemished by a high level of uncertainty - should we discount the value of future people? If so how much? Should we even value them? We could ask what&#39;s in it for us to provide a good future for our descendants or it could also be argued that events that matter beyond your death don&#39;t have value since you can&#39;t perceive them. On the other hand, it&#39;s difficult to disprove the hypothesis that our descendants matter. Many people consider putting the interests of the current generation above future generations to be selfish.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop of great uncertainty, how should we act as a society? Since there is so much uncertainty, it makes sense for us to prepare for the possibility that we are wrong. In the future, people might discover that the future is incredibly important or not; but right now we simply don&#39;t know what the true answer is. As a society, the most rational thing to do is to spread our bets in case we are wrong. Putting all our eggs in one basket and betting on one answer is risky. Instead, it makes sense to apply effort to both directions - to look after the interests of current and future people.</p>\n<p>I think the balance is tipped a little too far towards the interests of people current alive and too little effort is being put into the long term future. This makes sense because, as humans, our natural tendency is to focus on the short term.

The idea is that when everyone focuses on what they are good at, society ends up better off. It is more efficient to have a doctor and a programmer than two people who can do both. Focus on areas that are neglected because it&#39;s not that valuable to be the millionth something. Ask yourself what kind of work would lead to the most positive value in the world for yourself and others. Personally, I&#39;m interested in AI safety because it&#39;s a neglected field relative to the magnitude of the consequences AI could have in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I have calculated that the total aggregate value of our descendants is vastly greater than the aggregate value of all people based on some shaky assumptions (3). Though even when a high discount factor (1000) is applied to the value of future lives and the conclusion is weakened by a factor of 100 due to uncertainty about whether or not it is true, the conclusion still holds - the total value of our future descendants is much greater than the total value of all people today if some shaky assumptions hold true.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s unclear whether this conclusion is true, perhaps it could be completely wrong.

A case can be made for altruism - other people are very similar to us (taking a wide view) so it could be argued that each person in the world is roughly equally valuable. If this is true, then the most important factor determining what decisions we make should be how our decisions affect other people. If you make a decision that affects you and thousands of other people and you value other people as much as you value yourself, then you would classify the impact of your decision on other people as far more important than the impact of the decision on you. A person with this mindset would live for others and prioritize the needs of others over their own. If one also considers the impact of their actions on future people, then the ratio of the importance of others to that person would grow even larger. It would be rational for a person with such a view to be extremely altruistic where the decisions they make are almost entirely determined by their impact on the vast number of present and potential future people.</p>\n<h2 id=\"selfishness\">Selfishness</h2>\n<p>Selfishness is defined - in this context - as the tendency to prioritize your own needs over others&#39; needs. There are some arguments in favor of selfishness. For example, maybe people are better at managing their own needs without interference from others. This point is supported by research that shows that gift-giving is not the optimal way of using resources. However, since some people are not able to provide for themselves, a complete lack of altruism would lead to extra inequality and preventable suffering. Also we intuitively discount the value of other people, especially people who are not related to us or who we don&#39;t know. Would you sacrifice your life to save a stranger? A person with an impersonal perspective who values themselves and the stranger equally would have no preference - not saving the stranger results in the same loss as saving the stranger and dying. In a society of completely impersonal people, half of the population would choose to save the stranger and the other half would save themselves.</p>\n<p>I imagine that, in the real world, most people would choose to save themselves then a random stranger. If this is true, then in the example above, the number of people who would decide to save themselves would be greater. This intuitively makes sense but evolution also predicts this behavioral pattern. In his book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, Richard Dawkins explains how we are designed to promote the survival of our genes and why we value ourselves most, then our families and then strangers. We share 100% of my genes with ourselves, 50% with our siblings and parents and much less with strangers. It is no coincidence that altruism is related to the how close we are genetically to others. We also show a limited form of altruism to friends but this form of altruism tends to be reciprocal where each party benefits. True altruism where one person loses something so that someone else can gain something is more common in blood relatives. The most familiar example of this kind of altruism is when a mother makes sacrifices for her children.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evolution-and-ethics\">Evolution and Ethics</h2>\n<p>We may have built-in goals to increase the frequency of our genes in the gene pool but is this right? I don&#39;t think increasing the frequency of your genes in the gene pool is morally good. Instead, our moral systems are built on evolutionary rules of thumb designed promote the survival of our genes which we call feelings. For example, a world with less hunger and pain would be a better world. We value the quality of our conscious experience not the goals built into us by evolution even though our experience is heavily influenced by evolution. Therefore, achieving our evolutionary goals would increase the quality of our conscious experience. For example, eating satisfies the our built-in desire to survive and results in a better quality of life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maximize-well-being-not-evolutionary-goals\">Maximize Well-Being Not Evolutionary Goals</h2>\n<p>Although our personal goal of maximizing our quality of life is closely tied to how well we are achieving our evolutionary goals, these goals are not equal to each other. The fact that we have negative emotions is evidence that there is conflict between our personal goals and the goals of our genes. We have negative emotions not because they improve our quality of life but because they improve our chance of survival. Satisfying our evolutionary goals happens to improve our quality of life but evolution&#39;s goal is not to maximize our quality of life. Another problem with evolution is that it has created zero-sum games to increase our reproductive success but which limit the total happiness of a group of people. For example, only ten people in each country can enjoy being on the list of the richest ten people in that country. If everyone were to become wealthier, there would still be ten people on that list and so the total happiness in a population resulting from high social status cannot increase beyond a certain point.</p>\n<p>Since survival today is much less difficult than it was in the past, we could implement new cultural norms that prioritize happiness and bias our natural desires towards achieving happiness. Further into the future, we could change re-engineer ourselves to have the built-in goal of maximize well-being as opposed to our current built-in goal of maximizing reproductive success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Outright altruism or selfishness are controversial so maybe the best way of doing things is to take actions that maximize the the wellbeing of yourself and the wellbeing of others. For example, one way of doing this is to do work that you are passionate about that also benefits other people as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Since evolution is amoral, it may be morally right for us to fundamentally change our bodies and brains to attain more happiness and well-being.</p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/essays/productivityLessonsFromMozart","name":"Productivity Lessons From Mozart","parent":"home/essays","contents":"<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You don&#39;t need to work long hours per week to achieve a lot in your life.

Owing to the number of concerts, and also the uncertainty whether I may not be summoned to one place or another, I cannot rely on my evening writing, so it is my custom (especially when I come home early) to write for a time before going to bed. I often sit up writing till one, and rise again at six.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From reading other sources, I&#39;ve discovered that he was referring to composition when he said he &#39;wrote&#39; so this means he spent two hours on composition in the morning from 7:00 am - 9:00 am. He then gave music lessons. Other sources have said that he had long conversations with friends over dinner in the afternoon. He said his routine varies so let&#39;s assume that he began composing again at 6:00 pm until 9:00 pm. I&#39;m going to assume that he followed this part of his routine four times per week because sometimes he had to attend concerts. He then spent the time before bed writing letters, reading or more composing (this is based on other sources too)t. In total, he would have spent around five hours per day composing and roughly 30 hours per week on composition. Although he worked hard overall, he didn&#39;t spend a massive amount of time on composing which is what he is famous for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"insights\">Insights</h3>\n<p>I found this statement from Mozart&#39;s routine fascinating, &quot;I cannot rely on my evening writing.&quot; It seems like he felt an obligation to be productive everyday. In other words, it seems like he had some kind of daily creative quota where no matter what, he always got a certain amount of work done.</p>\n<p>Another insight is that he was very clear about his identity. He saw composing as his true work. He focused on one activity and knew that composing was the most important part of his day. </p>\n<p>Mozart increased the reliability of his productivity breaking his daily workload into three slots. He had a morning block for composition, a less reliable evening block and a night block. If he missed any of these three blocks, he could always rely on the other two to make sure that he got enough done. This added redundancy in his routine improved his productivity.</p>\n<p>It also surprises me that such a productive individual could have a fairly moderate routine. 30 or 40 hours per week of week is fairly typical. However, I imagine that he was very focused and also, he was working on high impact work.</p>\n<p>Mozart&#39;s life shows that you can have an incredibly productive life if you work consistently and efficiently and work in the right area at the right time. You don&#39;t have to work like a slave to be highly productive - it&#39;s possible to achieve a lot while also having time for other activities. But you need to ensure that you do work everyday, are focused on one goal above all others and work efficiently during those blocks you allocate for work.</p>\n<p>Another point worth considering is that Mozart happened to be working in the right area at the right time. Since music is information, it spreads much faster than anything physical so it&#39;s no surprise that many musicians are famous. This explains why software companies are so successful nowadays - it&#39;s much easier to expand the market of a product when expansion is not limited by the transport of physical goods. He also lived during the golden era of classical music so his work was in high demand. If Mozart was alive today, he would have been far less successful as classical music has been replaced with new forms of music. Also, the competition musicians face nowadays is far stiffer than it was in Mozart&#39;s time. </p>\n<p>The fact that Mozart&#39;s legacy has lasted so long is worth considering. The reason why we still hear about Mozart today is because composition is an art form with almost unlimited endurance. Any form of writing can last thousands of years. An important part of deciding what to work on could be whether what you are doing will have a lasting impact or not.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://stephenmcaleese11.gitbook.io/knowledge/~/drafts/-LZtpXEbJtNj0koVsKb7/primary/mind/productivity\">another article</a>, I asserted that your productivity per year has three elements: efficiency or how much work you get done per hour, the number of hours per day you work and the number of days you work per year. Mozart was highly productive because he worked efficiently (more below), he worked for a decent number of hours per day (around 5), and he worked almost everyday of the year because of his mindset of having a sense of obligation to be more productive per day and his reliable chunking method (three blocks of work per day which creates some redundancy).</p>\n<p>But how do we know he worked efficiently and if so, how did he do it? It&#39;s easy to pretend to work without actually doing anything but Mozart wouldn&#39;t have suffered from this problem for several reasons. Mozart had deadlines which he had to reach otherwise he wouldn&#39;t get payed. It would also be embarrassing to miss deadlines. Thus he had a strong incentive to actually do work - no work, no money - unlike many employees who simply have to show up for a few hours per day and collect their paycheck. </p>\n<p>This story outlines the extent of Mozart&#39;s efficiency: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Mozart was out drinking with friends October 28th, 1787, the night before “Don Giovanni’s” premiere [one of his most famous operas], when one friend remarked that Mozart had not written the overture for his opera yet. At around midnight, Mozart went to his room and composed this work within about three hours that night, kept awake by his wife, Constanze, telling him stories of Aladdin’s lamp, Cinderella and so on.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The overture (beginning) of &#39;Don Giovanni&#39; is around six minutes long. Although, overtures were typically composed after the rest of the opera meaning that the composer would already be prepared to write it, creating a six minute song in three hours is pretty impressive. He was able to be so efficient because he was entirely focused on one thing and he was under time pressure to be productive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-i-could-improve\">How I Could Improve</h3>\n<p> I&#39;d like to be more consistent in my work by creating either an actual or mental productivity quota. Also, spreading my work over several blocks throughout the day would increase my productivity. I do most of my work in the evening. Instead, I think I would be more reliably productive if I had a morning, an evening and a night block of work as Mozart did.</p>\n<p>To be more productive, I would also like to schedule discrete blocks of time where I do only work. Up until now, I have sort of multi-tasked between several kinds of activities. Instead I would like to schedule blocks where I only do exactly one activity with full focus as I find this approach more productive. I read somewhere that it takes twenty minutes to refocus fully after you are distracted so I think I would be more productive if I had more blocks of time where I focus fully on the task at hand. Setting deadlines will probably increase my productivity too as it adds a sense of urgency to your work.</p>\n<p>On what to work on, I would like to work in an area that is under-exploited as those areas have the most opportunities to make an impact. To use mining as an analogy, you want to mine areas that still have hidden deposits instead of exhausted mines. The areas that contain hidden gems are those that are rich in deposits but unexploited for some reason. I&#39;d imagine some areas are neglected because of their counter-intuitive nature. Also, it&#39;s best to work on the cutting edge. Fields often follow an S-curve where a lot of work goes into setting them up, there is rapid progress followed by maturity and diminishing returns. Finally, ensure that at least some of your work has a long-lasting impact. The best way to increase the longevity of your work is to record it in writing, on the internet or other means.</p>\n<p>I found it encouraging to discover that someone as productive as Mozart only spent around 40 hours per week composing. This shows that it&#39;s possible to be incredibly productive while still have some reasonably balanced lifestyle. However, being productive while having a balanced lifestyle is only possible if you work efficiently with a focus on productivity and accomplishment instead of just showing up to work. This quote by Thomas Edison expresses the same point well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Being busy does not always mean real work. The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought, system, planning, intelligence, and honest purpose, as well as perspiration. Seeming to do is not doing.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another point worth considering is that although Mozart did a lot of work, he did so over a long period of time which a reminder that work takes time to do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-lessons-learned-from-mozart-s-life\">Other Lessons Learned From Mozart&#39;s Life</h3>\n<p>He became a better composer by studying past composers&#39; work and travelling around Europe and listening to the music of other composers. The takeaway here is that learning from other people is incredibly important and that you can&#39;t invent every idea yourself.</p>\n<p>When Mozart was a boy, he loved challenging learning challenging songs. It&#39;s important to challenge yourself and push new boundaries if you want to be better. Being passionate about your work is also important.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quotes-by-mozart\">Quotes by Mozart</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Believe me, I do not like idleness but work.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I pay no attention to anyone&#39;s praise or blame.

The book is called &#39;Civilization: The West and the Rest&#39;.</p>\n<p>Below, my goal is to explain how western Europe advanced so quickly and dominated the rest of the world. I then explain how the insights learned from history can be applied to your life to make you more effective.</p>\n<h1 id=\"change\">Change</h1>\n<p>Europe was made up of dozens of small, autonomous states which competed with each other for economic and political power. Meanwhile, China in the east was a large monolithic empire. Chinese values around the 1400s promoted harmony and stability. While European states were developing new innovations to out-compete their rivals, China was focused on maintaining equilibrium. Since there cannot be improvement without change, China stagnated while Europe continued to improve.</p>\n<p>Over a short period of time, the difference in progress would not have been noticeable. But over time, incremental innovations added up to give Europe huge military and and economic advantages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"science-vs-religion\">Science vs Religion</h3>\n<p>Science and religion have two different approaches to truth. Science takes ignorance as an initially condition. The goal from that initial condition is to change and learn constantly. Because ignorance is the starting point of science, science encourages a disdain of the past and hope for a more enlightened future.</p>\n<p>Religion teaches quite the opposite. In many religions, the full truth was discovered in the past and the goal of the present and future is to preserve that knowledge. The problem is that many religions teachings are vague and unfalsifiable. When a theory cannot be falsified, we cannot discard it, move on and make progress. Since religion often teaches that the truth is in the past, there is an incentive to not make any changes to your beliefs - any change would be viewed as moving away from the truth.</p>\n<p>This view would make sense if your religious beliefs were right. But since many religions beliefs - such as the belief that the earth is the center of the universe as Christians believed in the middle ages - are wrong, Religion tends to stop progress by stopping changes in belief.</p>\n<h1 id=\"spreading-of-ideas\">Spreading of Ideas</h1>\n<p>In Europe, people shared and copied ideas. For example, Benjamin Robbins, an Englishman, wrote &#39;New Principles of Gunnery&#39; which greatly improved the accuracy of artillery. Prussia later used the ideas described to improve the accuracy of their artillery. Leonard Euler, the famous mathematician, improved the book. Isaac Newton built on top of the work of George Hook when working on gravity.</p>\n<p>These examples shows how ideas were constantly being shared and copied in Europe. Someone would come up with a new useful idea. Then everyone else would copy it making the idea a new standard. In the process of copying, someone else might improve the idea. This process of sharing, copying and changing lead to rapid progress. The copying part is significant because other people would not have been able to improve ideas if they did not have access to them.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile in the Ottoman Empire, printing and the astronomical predictions were banned because they were deemed blasphemous. The Ottomans couldn&#39;t access the latest scientific work from Europe and fell behind. </p>\n<h1 id=\"reason-vs-tradition\">Reason vs Tradition</h1>\n<p>The system of law implemented in the Ottoman Empire was based on religious principles. Since religion does not change and is rarely questioned, Sharia Law, like most things associated with religion, was rarely questioned and thus didn&#39;t change or improve.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in Europe, the Church and state were separated. This meant that law could freely change and be questioned. Over time, laws could be changed, debated and improved. Consequently, European countries ended up with much more effective systems of government than the Ottoman Empire.</p>\n<p>The freedom of expression that is possible in the absence of religious oppression is also matters in the context of improvement. The ability to express your ideas and arguments openly as writing or speech moves ideas from the subconscious to the conscious mind.</p>\n<p>These ideas can then be consciously critiqued. We have two systems of thought in our minds - system one and system two. System one is fast and intuitive but error prone. The more conscious and thoughtful system two is much better suited to the analysis of ideas.</p>\n<p>Freedom of writing and speech promoted system two thinking. System two is better at picking up errors than system one. As a result, Europeans were more likely to pick up faulty laws. The problem is not making mistakes - it&#39;s making mistakes and not fixing them because either you are not aware them or unwilling to fix them because of some kind of dogma. Europeans would have been better at picking up on mistakes and when you are aware of mistakes, you are more likely to fix them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"goals\">Goals</h1>\n<p>Surprisingly, China was ahead of Europe in seafaring. Admiral Zhong He, a famous Chinese explorer, had already reached east Africa by 1420, decades before Columbus visited the Caribbean. So why did Europe create global Empires and not China?</p>\n<p>One reason is that ocean going vessels were banned not long after Zhong He&#39;s voyages. This made further exploration almost impossible. Meanwhile in Europe, many of the Kings and Queens in Europe promoted exploration. The takeaway is that incentives and punishment have a significant influence on behavior.</p>\n<p>But even if China continued to explore, Europe may still have prevailed. Another key difference between European and Chinese sailors is how their motives differed. Chinese sailors went abroad to show off their might and acquire gifts to bring back to China.</p>\n<p>European sailors, on the other hand, had much more practical motives. Portuguese sailors went to Asia by sailing eastwards not to show off but to find another way to get spices. Other European explorers had similarly practical motives. Over time Europe set up forts, trading posts and colonies in Asia and profited from them. European explorers were more interested in exploring for their own long term economic and strategic benefit than the Chinese. </p>\n<p>The European explorers also pursued their goals with more fervor. For example, Vasco de Gama forced the port of Calcutta to open for trade by bombarding it. For the Europeans, exploration was much more than just an exercise in showing off - it was a way to outdo their nearby competitors on the European mainland. The competitiveness, focus and urgency of the European explorers was another significant advantage they had over the Chinese.</p>\n<p>What can we learn from the contrast between the Chinese and European explorers?  Certainly, the goals you choose are important in determining long term outcomes. Also, incentives and punishments are powerful ways of changing behavior and competition can help you achieve your goals more quickly and thoroughly.</p>\n<h1 id=\"applying-the-lessons-learned-above-to-your-personal-life\">Applying the Lessons Learned Above to your Personal Life</h1>\n<p>Learning about history is interesting, but what we learn from history can also be useful in our own personal lives. So how can we personally make use of the advantages the West had over other parts of the world?</p>\n<h2 id=\"change\">Change</h2>\n<p>Unlike most of the world, Europe was constantly changing and innovating. To improve, we can try new things, experiment and change our current methods of doing things. Often, change results in negative progress but occasionally a change results in improvement. Change can be done with foresight - you can imagine how you could be better, but sometimes blind or random change can also lead to improvement. This is especially relevant to evolution which has produced all its improvements through blind, unplanned change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"science-vs-religion\">Science vs Religion</h2>\n<p>Although, religion has much less of an influence on people&#39;s mind than it has in the past - from my own experience - religious thinking is still surprising common. &#39;Religious&#39; thinkers tend to have black and white beliefs, aren&#39;t open to new ideas, resist changes to their own beliefs, don&#39;t question their own beliefs. Religious thinkers also tend to be arrogant - they assume that their view of the world is right rather than acknowledging that there is always some uncertainty about whether a fact is true or not and sometimes we are just plain wrong about things.</p>\n<p>The opposite of a &#39;religious&#39; or irrational thinker is a rational thinker. Why would you want to be a rational thinker? A rational thinker is more equipped to create an accurate model of reality. This model can then be used to achieve goals.</p>\n<p>Rational thinkers acknowledge that their beliefs may be wrong and are willing to change their beliefs in the future as a result. They are also open to new ideas and acknowledge that it is a lot easier to be wrong than to be right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spreading-of-ideas\">Spreading of Ideas</h2>\n<p>Learn from other people. Sharing your ideas and getting other perspectives on your ideas can reveal oversights or mistakes you missed. Also, ideas you share could be improved in unexpected ways by other people.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reason-vs-tradition\">Reason vs Tradition</h2>\n<p>Make important decisions consciously because this process allows you to carefully analyze each step of your decision making. Realize that the traditional way of doing things is not necessarily the best way. New ideas that make sense may be superior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals\">Goals</h2>\n<p>Choose your goals carefully and consider the long term consequences. Competition can increase your motivation to achieve your goals. </p>\n","folder":0}]}}
