It&#39;s difficult to know what to do when there are so many possibilities. For example, there are hundreds of careers to choose from so how do you choose one?</p>\n<p>I think it&#39;s important to avoid what I call the trap of opportunity cost. We often know what we want to do but forgo doing it because we know there could be a better option. That is the trap at play. </p>\n<p>Instead, focus on making your life as good as possible. Have the goal of improving your life rather than avoiding opportunity cost.</p>\n<p>The reason why is that the opportunity cost trap is fundamentally self-defeating. You will never attain perfection so stop trying. Just keep making your life better and accept that there are always going to be flaws in your life.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
