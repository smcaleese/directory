<li>a clearly defined goal</li>

<p>Evolution has produced phenomenal improvements in the past few hundred million years. This was possible because the evolutionary process had the three features above. The 'goal' of evolution is to keep genes in existence as effectively as possible by designing organisms that is survive and reproduce as effectively as possible. Random mutations in DNA are the source of change and environmental pressures are the filter - animals that can't survive die and better adapted ones survive. Note that evolution's filter is perfectly suited to achieving survival - if the goal is the survival of genes, a filter that removes genes that are not good at surviving is the best possible filter as it's perfectly in line with the goal.</p>
