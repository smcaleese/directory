Coincidentally, the figure happened to be exactly 58% for both genders!</p>\n<p>This means that, according to the data I&#39;ve collected, I am exactly bisexual - right between heterosexual and homosexual. However, there is bound to be some inaccuracies in this result so I&#39;d say I&#39;m roughly, as opposed to exactly bisexual. In other words, I might have a slight lean towards either gender.</p>\n","folder":0}]},"siteData":{"title":"React Static"}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/bootstrap.bd1d042d.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/src/containers/Note.4d41f4ed.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.1f3d5f95.js"></script></body></html>
