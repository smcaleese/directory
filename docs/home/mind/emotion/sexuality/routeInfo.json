Swipe right if the answer is yes, otherwise swipe left. Also, be honest about your swipes.</p>\n<p>Now change the gender displayed to the opposite gender keeping the age range the same. Keep all other variables the same.</p>\n<p>Out of one hundred swipes of this gender (the opposite of the initial gender), record how many were to the right.</p>\n<p>Compare the number of right swipes for each gender. If you have a high percentage of right swipes for the opposite gender and a low percentage for your gender, then you are probably heterosexual. If you found the opposite pattern, then you are probably homosexual. A balanced percentage of right swipes between both genders suggests that you are bisexual.</p>\n<p>Note: this test only determines your preferences for physical attractiveness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-result\">My Result</h2>\n<p>I found that I swiped 58% (based on 100 swipes) to the right for both genders (in my age range: 18 - 22). Coincidentally, the figure happened to be exactly 58% for both genders!</p>\n<p>This means that, according to the data I&#39;ve collected, I am exactly bisexual - right between heterosexual and homosexual. However, there is bound to be some inaccuracies in this result so I&#39;d say I&#39;m roughly, as opposed to exactly bisexual. In other words, I might have a slight lean towards either gender.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
