<p>The scientific method is one of the most effective ways to find the truth.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Observation</strong>: you see something that you want to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: create a possible explanation of the observation.</li>
<li><strong>Prediction</strong>: make a prediction based on your experiment.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong>: how different is the result to your prediction? Then adjust your hypothesis accordingly.</li>
<li>Continue step 2 to 4 until your hypothesis is as accurate as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="first-principles-thinking">First Principles Thinking</h3>
<ul>
<li>First principles are facts that have a very high probability of being correct.</li>
<li>Example: Newton's second law of motion.</li>
<li>First principles are almost impossible to falsify.</li>
<li>How to find first principles:<ul>
<li>think of simple facts; it is important that they are simple, otherwise you will probably make a mistake.</li>
<li>continually try to falsify each truth.</li>
<li>If you cannot falsify it, then you can accept it as a first principle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every further logical step from the first principles must be correct in order to arrive at a conclusion that is correct.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rules-for-thinking-from-rene-descartes-">Rules for thinking from Rene Descartes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Divide each problem into as many parts are needed to solve it.</li>
<li>Order your thoughts from the simple to the complex.</li>
<li>Always check thoroughly for oversights. (things that you may have missed)</li>
<li><p>Never accept anything except clear and distinct ideas.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accept as true only what is indubitable.</p>
</li>
<li>Divide every question into manageable parts. Begin with the simplest issues and ascend to the more complex. Review frequently enough to retain the whole argument at once.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-think-creatively-">How to think creatively:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Substitute something for another.</li>
<li>Combine two ideas.</li>
<li>Adapt: change another idea to create a new idea.</li>
<li>Magnify</li>
<li>Put to another use?</li>
<li>Eliminate?</li>
<li>Rearrange or reverse?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you are far from the truth, make large changes to your view to get closer to the truth. When you are close to the truth, make small adjustments so that you do not overshoot and end up becoming more wrong.</li>
<li>If you are very wrong, inverting your reasoning may help.</li>
<li>Remember that your goal is to become less wrong. Your degree of error is always positive or zero. The goal is to have an error of zero but this is rarely achieved in the real world.</li>
<li>Finding the truth is like hitting a target with a bow and arrow. Constant adjustment and feedback is required and you are much more likely to miss the target than hit it.</li>
<li>Refusing to change your views is only useful once you know you have found the answer. Otherwise you are refusing to become less wrong.</li>
<li>You need two abilities to improve:<ul>
<li>the ability to change your world model based on experience.</li>
<li>the ability to remember your most previous and best model to prevent regression. Writing it down may help with this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Falsification is more powerful than proof.</li>
<li>Example: hypothesis: All Americans are nice. Finding a single mean American would invalidate this hypothesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, we are inclined towards confirming what we believe rather than falsifying it even though falsification often leads you to the truth faster.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beware of local minimums: sometimes is it better to try a completely different approach then to make progress on your current approach.</li>
</ul>
