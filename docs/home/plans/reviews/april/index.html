<p>Last month I planned to learn more programming and build more things. Unfortunately, I don't think I've learned new things as fast as I could have. I think this happened because I didn't spend enough time on programming.</p>
<p><strong>Next month</strong>: In the future, learn by doing and breaking down skills into sub-skills should accelerate my rate of learning. Build as many new things as possible as practice. Spend more time on programming.</p>

<p>My social life has been fine. </p>
<p><strong>Next month:</strong> Continue to reach out to existing friends and make more friends.</p>
<h1 id="experiences">Experiences</h1>
<p>I probably could have had more new experiences in the past month. April has passed by fairly quickly and the reason why is possibly because you haven't had many new experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Next month</strong>: Make an effort to have travel more and have new experiences.</p>

<p>I'd like to get into the habit of meditating everyday to calm my mind and increase focus.</p>
