Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve learned new things as fast as I could have. I think this happened because I didn&#39;t spend enough time on programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Next month</strong>: In the future, learn by doing and breaking down skills into sub-skills should accelerate my rate of learning. Build as many new things as possible as practice. Spend more time on programming.</p>\n<h1 id=\"relationships\">Relationships</h1>\n<p>My social life has been fine. </p>\n<p><strong>Next month:</strong> Continue to reach out to existing friends and make more friends.</p>\n<h1 id=\"experiences\">Experiences</h1>\n<p>I probably could have had more new experiences in the past month. April has passed by fairly quickly and the reason why is possibly because you haven&#39;t had many new experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Next month</strong>: Make an effort to have travel more and have new experiences.</p>\n<h1 id=\"other\">Other</h1>\n<p>I&#39;d like to get into the habit of meditating everyday to calm my mind and increase focus.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
