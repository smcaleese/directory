<p>This month, I feel I've made some progress on understanding how to live and other related philosophical issues. So far though, I've gained insights only through much mental effort. Recently however, I feel I've developed enough of a understanding of many philosophical problems to make faster progress.</p>
<p>My progress seems to be following an S-curve and I think I'm approaching the middle of the curve. I expect to see diminishing returns soon so I'll begin concrete planning and execution as opposed to only thinking about things.</p>
<p>Also, I think I have been more open to new ideas and less mentally rigid in the past month which is an improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Next month</strong>: clarify your understanding of the source of values and motivation. Solve the direction problem or what you should do. Then create a guide for how to live, and a personal life plan. If you fail to make progress on these philosophical issues or are progressing too slowly, just start executing a backup life plan which you can then refine over time.</p>
<p>I feel a sense of urgency about solving the problems above. Solving these problems is merely a means to an end where the end is the achievement of goals. Therefore, I need to solve these problems soon. I also think the insights I gain will be valuable to other people who are unsure about what to do.</p>
<h2 id="directory">Directory</h2>
<p> Make the core section highly compact. This will ensure that I can edit everything and that I have only very high quality content there. </p>
<p>Write about only the most general and valuable ideas. I think there is a limited supply of these so I expect the number of contributions I make to directory to decrease over time.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>
<p>I'm beginning to appreciate the importance of living a more balanced life. I think I can live a more varied lifestyle with a low impact to my productivity if I manage my time well and work efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Social life</strong>: spend more time with people.</p>
<p><strong>College</strong>: I've been getting my work done more quickly which is good.</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong>: I've realized that thinking is a better use of my time than reading so I'm reducing the amount of time I spend reading. Though bear in mind that the knowledge your acquire from reading supports good thinking. So read a little bit everyday.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep</strong>: go to bed earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Diet</strong>: eat a more varied diet and eat more calories.</p>
<p><strong>mindset</strong>: focus on improving over being competent. Be more open to flaws and failure because they are opportunities to improve. Have more of a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset.</p>
