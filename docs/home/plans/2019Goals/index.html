<p>I value achievement and I believe work adds meaning to life. I don't think it's enough to be happy in the short term. It's important to have long term satisfaction, meaning and direction.</p>
<h2 id="maximize-output">Maximize Output</h2>
<ul>
<li>programming: create useful applications. Focus on providing value.</li>

<li>reading: increase your knowledge base as much as possible</li>
<li>learning programming</li>

<h1 id="2-relationships">2. Relationships</h1>
<p>The quality of your relationships is strongly correlated with your level of happiness.</p>
<p>Build relationships that are as meaningful as possible. Focus on quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Real life interaction is way more valuable than online interaction in general.</p>
<p>Lower your expectations for your social life to reduce loneliness.</p>
<h1 id="3-experience">3. Experience</h1>
<p>First experiences seem to be particularly valuable suggesting that experiences have diminishing returns. For example, seeing a place ten times is much less than ten times as valuable as seeing the place once.</p>
<p>New experiences slow down the perception of time and make the past seem more 'full' in retrospect.</p>
<h1 id="time-division">Time Division</h1>
<p>I intend to spend most of my time on work. 40% output, 40% input, 10% on relationships and 10% on experiences sounds like a good split. Though I'll modify these ratios based on future experience.</p>
