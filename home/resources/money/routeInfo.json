They provide a lot of value because you use them regularly.</p>\n<p>These things may seem expensive when you buy them but when you spread the cost out over say a year, the cost is tiny.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Example: a €365 smartphone only costs €1 per day if you use it for a year.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Be wary of small regular expenses such as eating at restaurants. These costs add up quickly if you spend money</p>\n<p>on them everyday.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The relationship between spending and happiness has diminishing returns.
