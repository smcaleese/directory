# Productivity Lessons from Mozart

### Summary

* You don't need to work long hours per week to achieve a lot in your life. What matters most is that you choose the right area and work efficiently.
* On what to work on: work in important areas that few other people are working on because these areas still have unfinished work to be done. Do work that has a lasting positive impact by doing work that has permanence. 

#### How to Be More Productive

* Have a minimum productivity quota per day to promote consistency. Try to have a long streak of productivity across your calendar.
* To be more consistent, break your work done into several blocks per day so that if you miss one, you can still be productive that day.
* Focus - have a single identity and a single focus. Being a composer was part of Mozart's identity and composition was the main focus of his day. 
* Work efficiently: when you schedule a block for work, spend that time completely focused on getting as much work done as possible.
  * Have incentives such as deadlines to actually do work so that you avoid the trap of merely pretending to do work.

### Mozart's Routine

It has always amazed me how productive Mozart was. In the space of less than twenty years from his teenage years to his early death in his mid thirties he composed more than 600 works. How did he do it?

> _"Concerts every day and unending teaching, music-making, and composing. Where am I supposed to go? If only the concerts were over! It is impossible to describe the confusion and commotion." - Mozart_

As you can see, he was a very busy man. Even with a day job as a music teacher, he was able to be an incredibly productive composer. Below is a description of his routine in 1782 when he was 26 years old. He composed many of his most famous works in the mid 1780's so it would be interesting to see what his routine was like.

> _"At six o'clock in the morning I have my hair dressed, and have finished my toilet by seven o'clock. I write till nine. From nine to one I give lessons. I then dine, unless I am invited out, when dinner is usually at two o'clock, sometimes at three, as it was to-day, and will be to-morrow at Countess Zichi's and Countess Thun's. I cannot begin to work before five or six o'clock in the evening, and I am often prevented doing so by some concert; otherwise I write till nine o'clock. I then go to my dear Constanze, though our pleasure in meeting is frequently embittered by the unkind speeches of her mother, which I will explain to my father in my next letter._ 
>
> _Thence comes my wish to liberate and rescue her as soon as possible. At half-past ten or eleven I go home, but this depends on the mother's humor, or on my patience in bearing it. Owing to the number of concerts, and also the uncertainty whether I may not be summoned to one place or another, I cannot rely on my evening writing, so it is my custom \(especially when I come home early\) to write for a time before going to bed. I often sit up writing till one, and rise again at six."_

From reading other sources, I've discovered that he was referring to composition when he said he 'wrote' so this means he spent two hours on composition in the morning from 7:00 am - 9:00 am. He then gave music lessons. Other sources have said that he had long conversations with friends over dinner in the afternoon. He said his routine varies so let's assume that he began composing again at 6:00 pm until 9:00 pm. I'm going to assume that he followed this part of his routine four times per week because sometimes he had to attend concerts. He then spent the time before bed writing letters, reading or more composing \(this is based on other sources too\)t. In total, he would have spent around five hours per day composing and roughly 30 hours per week on composition. Although he worked hard overall, he didn't spend a massive amount of time on composing which is what he is famous for.

### Insights

I found this statement from Mozart's routine fascinating, "I cannot rely on my evening writing." It seems like he felt an obligation to be productive everyday. In other words, it seems like he had some kind of daily creative quota where no matter what, he always got a certain amount of work done.

Another insight is that he was very clear about his identity. He saw composing as his true work. He focused on one activity and knew that composing was the most important part of his day. 

Mozart increased the reliability of his productivity breaking his daily workload into three slots. He had a morning block for composition, a less reliable evening block and a night block. If he missed any of these three blocks, he could always rely on the other two to make sure that he got enough done. This added redundancy in his routine improved his productivity.

It also surprises me that such a productive individual could have a fairly moderate routine. 30 or 40 hours per week of week is fairly typical. However, I imagine that he was very focused and also, he was working on high impact work.

Mozart's life shows that you can have an incredibly productive life if you work consistently and efficiently and work in the right area at the right time. You don't have to work like a slave to be highly productive - it's possible to achieve a lot while also having time for other activities. But you need to ensure that you do work everyday, are focused on one goal above all others and work efficiently during those blocks you allocate for work.

Another point worth considering is that Mozart happened to be working in the right area at the right time. Since music is information, it spreads much faster than anything physical so it's no surprise that many musicians are famous. This explains why software companies are so successful nowadays - it's much easier to expand the market of a product when expansion is not limited by the transport of physical goods. He also lived during the golden era of classical music so his work was in high demand. If Mozart was alive today, he would have been far less successful as classical music has been replaced with new forms of music. Also, the competition musicians face nowadays is far stiffer than it was in Mozart's time. 

The fact that Mozart's legacy has lasted so long is worth considering. The reason why we still hear about Mozart today is because composition is an art form with almost unlimited endurance. Any form of writing can last thousands of years. An important part of deciding what to work on could be whether what you are doing will have a lasting impact or not.

In [another article](https://stephenmcaleese11.gitbook.io/knowledge/~/drafts/-LZtpXEbJtNj0koVsKb7/primary/mind/productivity), I asserted that your productivity per year has three elements: efficiency or how much work you get done per hour, the number of hours per day you work and the number of days you work per year. Mozart was highly productive because he worked efficiently \(more below\), he worked for a decent number of hours per day \(around 5\), and he worked almost everyday of the year because of his mindset of having a sense of obligation to be more productive per day and his reliable chunking method \(three blocks of work per day which creates some redundancy\).

But how do we know he worked efficiently and if so, how did he do it? It's easy to pretend to work without actually doing anything but Mozart wouldn't have suffered from this problem for several reasons. Mozart had deadlines which he had to reach otherwise he wouldn't get payed. It would also be embarrassing to miss deadlines. Thus he had a strong incentive to actually do work - no work, no money - unlike many employees who simply have to show up for a few hours per day and collect their paycheck. 

This story outlines the extent of Mozart's efficiency: 

> "Mozart was out drinking with friends October 28th, 1787, the night before “Don Giovanni’s” premiere \[one of his most famous operas\], when one friend remarked that Mozart had not written the overture for his opera yet. At around midnight, Mozart went to his room and composed this work within about three hours that night, kept awake by his wife, Constanze, telling him stories of Aladdin’s lamp, Cinderella and so on."

The overture \(beginning\) of 'Don Giovanni' is around six minutes long. Although, overtures were typically composed after the rest of the opera meaning that the composer would already be prepared to write it, creating a six minute song in three hours is pretty impressive. He was able to be so efficient because he was entirely focused on one thing and he was under time pressure to be productive.

### How I Could Improve

 I'd like to be more consistent in my work by creating either an actual or mental productivity quota. Also, spreading my work over several blocks throughout the day would increase my productivity. As you can see below, I do most of my work \(outside of college\) in the evening. Instead, I think I would be more reliably productive if I had a morning, an evening and a night block of work as Mozart did.

To be more productive, I would also like to schedule discrete blocks of time where I do only work. Up until now, I have sort of multi-tasked between several kinds of activities. Instead I would like to schedule blocks where I only do exactly one activity with full focus as I find this approach more productive. I read somewhere that it takes twenty minutes to refocus fully after you are distracted so I think I would be more productive if I had more blocks of time where I focus fully on the task at hand. Setting deadlines will probably increase my productivity too as it adds a sense of urgency to your work.

On what to work on, I would like to work in an area that is under-exploited as those areas have the most opportunities to make an impact. To use mining as an analogy, you want to mine areas that still have hidden deposits instead of exhausted mines. The areas that contain hidden gems are those that are rich in deposits but unexploited for some reason. I'd imagine some areas are neglected because of their counter-intuitive nature. Also, it's best to work on the cutting edge. Fields often follow an S-curve where a lot of work goes into setting them up, there is rapid progress followed by maturity and diminishing returns. Finally, ensure that at least some of your work has a long-lasting impact. The best way to increase the longevity of your work is to record it in writing, on the internet or other means.

I found it encouraging to discover that someone as productive as Mozart only spent around 40 hours per week composing. This shows that it's possible to be incredibly productive while still have some reasonably balanced lifestyle. However, being productive while having a balanced lifestyle is only possible if you work efficiently with a focus on productivity and accomplishment instead of just showing up to work. This quote by Thomas Edison expresses the same point well:

> _"Being busy does not always mean real work. The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought, system, planning, intelligence, and honest purpose, as well as perspiration. Seeming to do is not doing._

Another point worth considering is that although Mozart did a lot of work, he did so over a long period of time which a reminder that work takes time to do.

### Other Lessons Learned From Mozart's Life

He became a better composer by studying past composers' work and travelling around Europe and listening to the music of other composers. The takeaway here is that learning from other people is incredibly important and that you can't invent every idea yourself.

When Mozart was a boy, he loved challenging learning challenging songs. It's important to challenge yourself and push new boundaries if you want to be better. Being passionate about your work is also important.
