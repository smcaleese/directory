# Accelerating and Diminishing Returns in Life

## Diminishing returns

It makes sense to apply effort to activities with diminishing returns but only up to a point. At first, one unit of effort might yield two units so -1 effort + 2 gain = 1 net. Therefore the activity is worthwhile initially. After a while the same increase in effort will yield less and less results as the graph below shows. Eventually, as you apply more effort each unit of effort will yield almost no return so you will only experience net losses. At this point, it makes sense to stop investing effort. Brushing your teeth is an activity which experiences diminishing returns - after one minute, your teeth will be, say, 90% clean, 95% clean after the second minute and 98% clean after the third minute. It doesn't make sense to brush your teeth for ten minutes because the time wasted is greater than the cleanliness. Diminishing returns also applies to goods you buy in the shop. Five boxes of cereal is not five times more valuable than one box and if you were to buy a thousand boxes, the curve would actually move downward due to the inconvenience of storing them. The law of diminishing returns explains why people generally don't brush their teeth for an hour a day or buy hundreds of boxes of cereal.

## Accelerating Returns

Accelerating returns is the opposite of diminishing returns - each additional unit of effort yields a greater return up to a point and it is rational to apply more effort over time instead of less with time. Accelerating relationships between effort and returns is probably less common than diminishing returns but has a larger impact. 

Initially, one unit of effort may yield one unit of output. The second unit of effort yields two units, then three or four and so on. As each extra unit of effort has a greater reward than the last, it makes sense to continue to apply effort until the curve plateaus or until you are too tired. The law of accelerating returns applies in areas such as business, fame and sport. The 'winner-takes-all' scenario is a more extreme version of the law of accelerating returns. In this scenario, the beginning of the curve is almost completely flat and then suddenly spikes up when a large amount of effort is applied.

In winner-takes-all scenarios, there are two rational ways of acting - you should either apply no effort to minimize costs or you should apply maximum effort so that you get to the right side of the graph and pay off the effort-debt you have accumulated. Those who are in the middle of the graph are in the worst position - they have invested quite a lot of effort and received nothing in return.

I haven't described linear relationships because, in the real world, I don't think true linear relationships are that common. Relationships that appear linear might actually be slightly diminishing or accelerating. For example, a wage job seems linear at first, but actually the money earned has diminishing value - being twice as wealth probably won't double your standard of living.

## Applying Accelerating and Diminishing Returns to Your Life

The majority of situations your will encounter in your life probably involve only diminishing returns. Therefore for many of your decisions, you should take a balanced approach where you apply a small amount of effort and get a reasonable return. Fortunately this pattern of behavior is already fairly common - people buy a wide variety of groceries, stay fairly fit, acquire enough money for comfort and generally have a balanced approach to life.

However, this approach does not work when you are dealing with accelerating returns. The actor, athlete or entrepreneur who invests a moderate amount of effort will probably fail so they need to work hard. This is counter intuitive because most scenarios involve diminishing returns where hard work does not pay off - investing hours into brushing your teeth is wasteful. But that is not the case with sport, fame or music.

Mozart and Tiger Woods are examples of prodigies who have put in an extreme amount of effort which yielded an extremely high return. Tiger Woods was the first sports billionaire and Mozart is still famous 227 years later \(as of 2019\) - I recently heard one of his songs in a Burger King ad. However, although extreme effort can yield extraordinary results, it is also risky as there are many failures for every great success in winner-takes-all fields such as sport. If you want to succeed in these fields, you have to compete as hard as you can for the small chance of glory or not participate at all to cut your losses.

This same rule applies to startups. Most startups fail and some achieve spectacular success. Although luck is often involved, the founders that are most involved in what they are doing are the most likely to succeed. Taking luck into account, if luck is on your side, go for it but if your luck is against you, maybe you should avoid competing to avoid potential losses.

In conclusion, in most areas of life the best strategy is to apply moderate effort \(eg. brushing your teeth\). Though in some fields - such as entrepreneurship or sport - a small number of extremely dedicated people can enjoy a much greater return on their effort even taking into account the extra effort applied - Tiger Woods may have worked twice as hard as the average golfer, but he netted ten or twenty times more money and fame. Elon Musk also falls in this category - he worked incredibly hard to create Tesla which netted which ultimately resulted in very high financial gains. But if he had put been less committed, Tesla probably would have failed and he would have gained nothing. Although these kinds of fields seem attractive because of the high rewards associated with them, there is also a high risk of failure which needs to be taken into account.

To summarize, find out where accelerating and diminishing returns apply to your life. If there are diminishing returns then invest some effort but not too much. If you are doing something that involves accelerating returns such as getting out of poverty \(wealth begets wealth\), then invest a lot of effort. If you are in a winner-takes-all field involving strongly accelerating returns, then you should either invest an extremely large amount of effort, go all in and get to the top or cut your losses.

There are two rational ways to be - if there are diminishing returns such as when cleaning your house, you should apply some effort but not too much. If there are accelerating returns, then you should try much harder but only do so if you have a reasonable chance of success. This route has a higher potential reward but is also more risky.
